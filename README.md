This Shiny App is providing tools to be able to analyze the different parameters of the ChickWeight dataset.

We required you to provide the following information:

1. Filter by Diet to display a table with Chicks that follow that diet.

2. Select the X axis to be used in the plot.

3. Select the Y axis to be used in the plot.

4. Select points in the graph to be able to get the slope and intercept (the minimum points selected must be 3)

5. Click Submit

The main tab will show the plot with the x and y axis selected and two tables. The table on the left will show the full dataset for ChickWeight. The table on the right will only show the dataset for the Diet that was selected.
